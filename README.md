## Goals
### Short-Term Goals
- explore more established model structures/approaches
- expand English handwritten data
- apply model to sequences of words (not just individual words)(point camera at a full sentence)
- prepare model for new single instance data 
- understand RNN (and MDRNN)

### Long-Term Goals
- datasets for other languages and more complex character sets
- have app that can be used to apply packaged model and capture new data actively
- release a downloadable app (maybe as a webapp also)
